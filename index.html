	<p>I am an applied mathematician who is broadly compelled by explaining the cell with pure and applied math. Currently, I am a <a href="https://ssqbiophd.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Systems Biology PhD </a> candidate at Harvard University advised by <a href="https://vcp.med.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Jeremy Gunawardena</a>. My doctoral research involves using graph theory and stochastic processes to understand how cellular information processing tasks, such as those in eukaryotic gene regulation, depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. I was a recipient of a scholarship funded by the NSF-Simons Center for Mathematical and Statistical Analysis of Biology at Harvard. Through a collaboration with Dr. Polly Yu, I contributed to a publication on disguised toric dynamical systems. </p>

	<p>As an undergraduate, I spent two summers as a research assistant with <a href="https://chavezlab.com/" target="_blank"> Alex Chavez</a> in George Churchâ€™s lab, where I worked on projects developing CRISPR/Cas9 transcriptional activators (which resulted in a Nature Methods publication) and neurodegenerative screens. I graduated from Middlebury College in 2018 with a B.A. in Mathematics and Biochemistry. My mathematics senior thesis in fluid dynamics focused on characterizing stability in laminar flows and the hydrodynamics of magnetotactic bacteria.</p>
