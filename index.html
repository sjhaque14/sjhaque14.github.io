	<p>I am a mathematician interested in exploring biochemical reaction networks and the geometry and topology of multi-scale biological systems. As of July 2024, I am a Van Loo Independent Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, co-hosted by the Michigan Center for Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics and Center for the Study of Complex Systems. I completed my PhD in <a href="https://ssqbiophd.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Systems Biology PhD </a> at Harvard University advised by <a href="https://vcp.med.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Jeremy Gunawardena</a>. My doctoral work explores graph-theoretic models of biochemical reaction networks, primarily through the linear framework. My background in graph theory and stochastic processes allows me to investigate open problems across disciplines, ranging from non-equilibrium thermodynamics to molecular information processing. I also have done work in chemical reaction network theory with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pollyyu" target="_blank"> Polly Yu</a>  on disguised toric systems, which is published in SIAM Journal of Dynamical Systems. 
	<br>
	<p> My goal is to become a professor in applied mathematics, and the break down the barriers between pure and applied math in pursuit of uncovering compelling descriptions of biological systems. While at Harvard, I was a recipient of multiple scholarships funded by the NSF-Simons Center for Mathematical and Statistical Analysis of Biology at Harvard and the Lynch Foundation. As an undergraduate, I spent two summers as a research assistant with <a href="https://chavezlab.com/" target="_blank"> Alex Chavez</a> in George Churchâ€™s lab, where I worked on projects developing CRISPR/Cas9 transcriptional activators (which resulted in a Nature Methods publication) and neurodegenerative screens. I graduated from Middlebury College in 2018 with a B.A. in Mathematics and Biochemistry. My mathematics senior thesis in fluid dynamics focused on characterizing stability in laminar flows and the hydrodynamics of magnetotactic bacteria.</p>
