I am a mathematician working at the intersection between graph theory, algebraic geometry and dynamical systems, with applications to biochemical reaction networks. 

I am a Van Loo Independent Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, co-hosted by the Michigan Center for Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics and the Center for the Study of Complex Systems. I completed my PhD in March 2024 in Systems Biology at Harvard University, advised by Dr. Jeremy Gunawardena. My PhD thesis develops graph-theoretic approaches to biochemical reaction networks, with particular emphasis on the linear framework. 
The mathematical foundations I cultivated during my PhD has shaped my current work on chemical reaction network theory, algebraic geometry and structural identifiability, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and active assembly of physical networks. I have collaborated previously with Dr. Polly Yu on disguised toric reaction networks, which is currently published in SIAM Journal of Dynamical Systems. 
I earned my B.A. in Mathematics and Biochemistry from Middlebury College in 2018.
